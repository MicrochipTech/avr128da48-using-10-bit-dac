Using 10-bit DAC for Generating Analog Signals

This repository contains examples of bare metal source code for DAC as described in "Using 10-bit DAC for Generating Analog Signals" document from Microchip.
The repository contains an Atmel Studio Solution with multiple projects inside. Make sure you have the necessary tools:

    1. AVR128DA48 device (or the AVR128DA48 Curiosity Nano board)
    2. Atmel Studio
    3. AVR128DA48 Device Packs

The following examples are inside this repository:

   1. Generating Constant Analog Signal using 10-bit DAC</li>
   2. Generating Sine Wave Signal using 10-bit DAC</li>
   3. Reading the DAC Internally with the ADC</li>
   4. Generating Amplitude Modulation Signal using 10-bit DAC</li>

The source code is compatible with the following devices: AVR128DA28, AVR128DA32, AVR128DA48, and AVR128DA64.
